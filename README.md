## About

A longer description of the project: what problem it solves, who should use it, and a brief overview of the implementation or tech stack.

Replace this paragraph with a concise pitch (2–4 sentences).

## Features

- Bullet list of main features
- Short, clear items users or contributors care about
- Keep it actionable (e.g., "Fast CSV parsing", "Docker-ready")

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

List required tools and versions. Example:

- Windows, macOS or Linux
- PowerShell (example commands below use PowerShell)
- Node.js >= 18 (if applicable)
- Python >= 3.10 (if applicable)
- Git

### Install

Quick start — clone and install dependencies. Replace placeholders with your project-specific commands.

PowerShell example:
```powershell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git
Set-Location -Path <your-repo>

# Install dependencies (Node.js example)
npm install
# or for Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If your project uses other tools (Docker, pnpm, yarn, poetry), show those alternatives.

## Usage

Show one or two concrete examples of how to run or use the project.

Examples:
```powershell
# Run the app (Node.js)
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

Replace with CLI flags or environment variables if needed:
```powershell
$Env:MYAPP_ENV = "production"
npm start
```

## Development

Short instructions for contributors and maintainers.
